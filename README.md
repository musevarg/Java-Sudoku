# Java Sudoku

I gave myself this challenge when I was at college.
The idea was to be able to create a valid and complete Sudoku Board.

It was harder than I thought because most of the time when picking random numbers out of the only valid numbers that can go in the position being worked on, the board cannot be completed.

This forced me to research and implement backtracking. If the current board doesn't have a solution, remove a few digits and start again.

I obtained the following result:

Later, I decided to make this playable and designed a GUI for it and a board checker.
